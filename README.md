# ROPTLIB
ROPTLIB: Riemannian Manifold Optimization Library


The library is used to solve an optimization problem

f(x), x \in \mathcal{M},

where \mathcal{M} is a Riemannian manifold.

The detalied instruction and user manual can be found at http://www.math.fsu.edu/~whuang2/Indices/index_ROPTLIB.html.
